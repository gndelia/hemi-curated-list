# Hemi curated list

Curated list of sites for users to bridge/tunnel/swap/trade on [Hemi](https://hemi.xyz/) (or in other chains). This is not an official list, but one maintained by me with official links.

Remember that to transfer tokens from Ethereum you can use the [Portal](https://app.hemi.xyz/en/tunnel/) - it's the official website to tunnel tokens from Ethereum. Supports a wide variety of tokens.

Always remember that the official list of HEMI addresses in every chain is in [here](https://docs.hemi.xyz/main/token-contract-details).
